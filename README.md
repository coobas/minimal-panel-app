# minimal-panel-app

A pedagogical implementation of panel apps served up on a remote machine.

See the full app [here](http://minimal-panel-app.herokuapp.com/minimal-panel).

## why this project exists

I spent a day figuring out how to make this happen at work,
and decided to spend an evening consolidating my knowledge.

## "how to use"

```
git clone https://github.com/ericmjl/minimal-panel-app
```

## anything else interesting?

### iPad development

The first version of the app was coded up entirely on an iPad,
using a combination of [blink](http://blink.sh)
[Juno](jhttp://juno.sh),
and `nano` on my home remote server
(which is nothing more than a converted gaming tower).

Web app development in Python is now doable
and we can use modern tablets as a thin client!

### memory usage

Deploying the HIV drug resistance model to Heroku was challenging
because I had to watch out for memory and storage usage.
There are 8 models to make predictions on,
and loading all of them together causes memory overload
on Heroku's free tier.

I got around this by pickling the models individually,
and only loading them when needed.
I also minimized disk usage by using gzip
when pickling the files.
